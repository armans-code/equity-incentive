    title: 'Healthcare Inequity',
    description:
      'Health inequities are systematic differences in health outcomes. Health inequities are differences in health status or in the distribution of health resources between different population groups, arising from the social conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. When people from underprivileged or underrepresented societies face healthcare issues, there is no guarantee that they will face equal treatment. For example, one of the clearest examples is the difference between infant health and mortality among Black and white babies born in the U.S. Black people are more likely than white people to have babies with a low birth weight. This not only demonstrates the negative effects of racial equality in healthcare, but also demonstrates the detrimental impact of deep-rooted societal inequity in areas that do not have high incomes or employment rates. The inequity faced in healthcare settings leads to unequal treatment, especially based on race or income status, which results in low-income neighborhoods or communities having very little access to affordable and reliable healthcare.',

    title: 'Housing Inequity',
    description:
      'Housing inequality is a disparity in the quality of housing in a society which is a form of economic inequality. The right to housing is recognized by many national constitutions, and the lack of adequate housing can have adverse consequences for an individual or a family. The benefits from homeownership have not been shared equally.  In the second quarter of 2022, the homeownership rate for white households was 75 percent compared to 45 percent for Black households, 48 percent for Hispanic households, and 57 percent for non-Hispanic households of any other race.  Like the overall racial wealth gaps, these gaps in homeownership rates have changed little over the last three decades. In fact, the Black-white gap in homeownership rates was the same in 2020 as it was in 1970, just two years after the passage of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which sought to end racial discrimination in the housing market. The structural racial inequities built into the American housing system target those of low income, deep-rooted inequity and cause an obviously unstable crisis for those who have wealth disparities.',

    title: 'Education Inequity',
    description:
      "The dimension of educational inequity is tantamount in multiple roots. Globally, these differences correlate with the level of development of various countries and regions. In individual States, access to school is tied to, among other things, students' overall well-being, their social origins and cultural backgrounds, the language their families speak, whether or not they work outside of the home and, in some countries, their sex. People who lack access to proper education in their area or online are given scarce further education opportunities, which leads to hardships in finding a sustainable job. This is one of the main causes of high joblessness rates in areas experiencing inequity. The lack of stable and reliable preliminary education directly leads to the opportunities that then would help them break the toxic cycle of inequitable education. Teachers are key agents for learning. Their training is crucial.  When insufficient priority is given to either initial or in-service teacher training, or to both, one can expect learning deficits. Teachers in poorer areas tend to have less training and to receive less in-service support. Disadvantaged students frequently encounter unfriendly or overtly offensive attitudes from both teachers and classmates in addition to improper basic fundamental. Such attitudes are derived from prejudices, stereotypes, outright racism and sexism. Students in hostile environments are affected in their disposition to learn, and many drop out early.",

    title: 'Transportation Inequity',
    description:
      'Transportation inequity is defined as unequal distribution of travel between social groups, related to transport resources, including car ownership, access to public transport, or indeed all forms of transport more generally. Generally, areas that have high inequity levels have less access to reliable transportation to and from education, jobs, homes, etc., causing them to have fewer opportunities in a working environment and severely decreasing their chances at financial success. Many Americans rely on public transit to get to work or other services, but neighborhoods throughout the country lack access to public transit, even at peak hours. And over 790,000 late-shift workers, who are disproportionately low-income people of color, rely on public transportation to get to work but have far fewer options. Average commute times for late-shift workers who take public transit are twice as long as those for workers with car access. This severe lack of public transit cuts their financial opportunities in half and further enforces the deep-rooted inequity in areas of low income and few resources.',
